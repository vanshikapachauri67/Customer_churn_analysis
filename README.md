# Customer_churn_analysis

The Customer Churn Analysis project aims to explore and analyze the factors that contribute to customer churn, such as contract types, payment methods, customer tenure, and demographic characteristics. By identifying these factors, businesses can take actionable steps to improve customer retention and reduce churn.
The analysis was performed using Python, with a focus on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and analyzed to derive insights into customer behavior.
